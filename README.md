# car-inventory

The car inventory text file was imported to excel using the necessary delimiters (comma).
Vertical lookup tables were used to generate the full name of the car make and model. 
The IF command was used to determine both the ages of the cars as well as whether the drivers had exceeded the mileage beyond which their cars were no longer covered by warranty.
A new car ID was generated using the CONCATENATE command to concatenate the required fields while simultaneously utilizing the UPPER, LEFT and RIGHT commands.  
Conditional formatting was used on the relevant data fields to further highlight certain information.
